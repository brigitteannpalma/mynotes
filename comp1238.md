##Week 1 Historical Introduction to Text and Writing

##Text and Numbers Throughout History

- The Origins of Writing
    - Cave paintings in France from 30,000 years ago
    - Ishango Bone, found in Africa and dated to about 20,000 years ago
    - We definitively recognize as writing appear much later, around 5,000 years ago (approximately 3000 BC). These come primarily from clay tablets discovered in Mesopotamia
- Cuneiform: Writing on Clay
    - Cuneiform is tied to the medium used: clay. Initially, people drew lines and shapes on wet clay
    - Cuneiform symbols often represented syllables (like 'ma', 'la', etc.), similar to the modern Japanese Hiragana or Katakana alphabets
- Numbers in Cuneiform
    - Mesopotamians also developed a sophisticated system for writing numbers using cuneiform
    - Sexagesimal (base-60) system
- Ancient Number Systems
    - Egyptian Numerals: The ancient Egyptians developed a system using hieroglyphs for powers of 10
    - Roman Numerals: The Roman system uses letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) to represent values
- The Power of Written Stories
    - Around 4,000 years ago (2000 BC), we find tablets containing the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known works of literature.
    - It was only rediscovered and deciphered by archaeologists in the 19th century, highlighting the fragility of knowledge transmission even with written records
- The Printing Revolution
    - Cylinder seals, like the one belonging to Queen Puabi from Mesopotamia (~4,500 years ago), were rolled onto clay to create repeating patterns or inscriptions, functioning like early stamps
    - Woodblock printing, where an entire page is carved into a wooden block, inked, and pressed onto paper, was used in China as early as the 9th century AD (e.g., the Diamond Sutra, 868 AD)
    - Metal movable type was developed in Korea in the 13th century
    - Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century in Europe who developed a comprehensive system for printing with movable metal type that sparked a revolution
- Terminology from the Printing Press
    - Typeface: The design or style of a set of characters
    - Font: a font was a complete set of type of one size and style
    - Font Weight: Refers to the thickness of the strokes
    - Serif vs. Sans-serif: Serif fonts have small decorative strokes or "feet" at the ends of characters
    - Typesetting: The process of arranging type to prepare text for printing
    - Uppercase and Lowercase: These terms originated from how metal type was stored

##Week 2 Representing Text and Numbers in Computers

- Binary System
    - Bit: Short for binary didigt, represents one of two states ( 0 or 1 )
    - Byte: Group of 8 bits
    - Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2
- Computer Memory: Volatile vs. Non-Volatile
    - Volatile Memory (Short-Term): It is characterized by being very fast, allowing quick reading and writing of data. However, it is volatile, meaning its contents are lost entirely when the power is turned off
    - Non-Volatile Memory (Long-Term/Persistent Storage): This memory is used for storing data persistently, even when the power is off. It is optimized for capacity and cost-effectiveness rather than raw speed
- Units of Measurement
    - Kilobyte (KB): Roughly one thousand bytes
    - Megabyte (MB): Roughly one million bytes
    - Gigabyte (GB): Roughly one billion bytes
    - Terabyte (TB): Roughly one trillion bytes
- Number Representation
    - Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits
    - Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits
    - Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers
- Text Files vs. Binary Files
    - Text Files: These are files where the sequence of bytes is intended to represent human-readable text characters, typically encoded using a standard like ASCII
    - Binary Files: These are files where the sequence of bytes is not primarily intended to represent text characters
- Positional Number Systems and Bases
    - Decimal (Base 10): Uses 10 digits (0-9). Positions represent powers of 10
    - Binary (Base 2): Uses 2 digits (0, 1). Positions represent powers of 2
    - Octal (Base 8): Uses 8 digits (0-7). Positions represent powers of 8. Less common now, but used historically
    - Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses 16 digits. It uses 0-9, and then the letters A-F to represent the values 10 through 15

## Week 3 Structure of Text

- Historical Perspectives on Text Structure
    - Ancient Manuscripts and Early Printing: Consider a page printed around 500 years ago in Venice, a major center for early printing
    - Ledgers and Tables: It's structured like a table, with clear rows and columns. Each column is dedicated to a specific type of information (e.g., quantity, price, item description)
    - Newspapers: It features huge titles (headlines), columns of text, and often images. The structure prioritizes grabbing attention and organizing diverse information into easily digestible sections.
- Markup Languages
    - Markdown: a very popular, simple markup language. It's designed to be easy to read and write in its raw text form, while still being easily convertible (rendered) into formatted documents (like HTML).
    - HTML: more verbose than Markdown but offers much greater flexibility and control over presentation and structure.
- Special Characters and Escaping
    - Special Characters: 
        - Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *
        - Escape sequences prevent special interpretation
        - Example: \# to display # in Markdown
    - HTML Escaping:
        - Use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &amp; for &.
- Structured Data
    - JSON (Javascript Object Notation) a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate
        - Objects: Key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys are strings, values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other objects
        - Arrays: Ordered lists of values, enclosed in square brackets []
    - XML (Extensible Markup Language) more verbose than JSON but also more flexible in defining complex document structures. It uses tags similar to HTML but allows defining custom tag names
        - Tags: <tag>value</tag>

## Week 4 Manipulating Text & Text Editors

- Keyboards
    - Importance: Keyboards and mice are our primary interface to convey thoughts/intentions to the computer. Mastering the keyboard is key
    - History: Word comes from musical instruments. Early typing keyboards looked like piano keys but quickly evolved to the modern layout for mechanical/convenience reasons
    - Types:
          - Standard 104-key layout
          - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards
    - Layouts:
          - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak
- Modifier Keys and Shortcuts
    - Keys like Control, Shift, and Alt
    - Ctrl + C (copy)
    - Ctrl + V (paste)
    - Ctrl + Z (undo)
    - Ctrl + F for finding text
