## Week 1 Historical Introduction to Text and Writing

## Text and Numbers Throughout History

- The Origins of Writing
    - Cave paintings in France from 30,000 years ago
    - Ishango Bone, found in Africa and dated to about 20,000 years ago
    - We definitively recognize as writing appear much later, around 5,000 years ago (approximately 3000 BC). These come primarily from clay tablets discovered in Mesopotamia
- Cuneiform: Writing on Clay
    - Cuneiform is tied to the medium used: clay. Initially, people drew lines and shapes on wet clay
    - Cuneiform symbols often represented syllables (like 'ma', 'la', etc.), similar to the modern Japanese Hiragana or Katakana alphabets
- Numbers in Cuneiform
    - Mesopotamians also developed a sophisticated system for writing numbers using cuneiform
    - Sexagesimal (base-60) system
- Ancient Number Systems
    - Egyptian Numerals: The ancient Egyptians developed a system using hieroglyphs for powers of 10
    - Roman Numerals: The Roman system uses letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) to represent values
- The Power of Written Stories
    - Around 4,000 years ago (2000 BC), we find tablets containing the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known works of literature.
    - It was only rediscovered and deciphered by archaeologists in the 19th century, highlighting the fragility of knowledge transmission even with written records
- The Printing Revolution
    - Cylinder seals, like the one belonging to Queen Puabi from Mesopotamia (~4,500 years ago), were rolled onto clay to create repeating patterns or inscriptions, functioning like early stamps
    - Woodblock printing, where an entire page is carved into a wooden block, inked, and pressed onto paper, was used in China as early as the 9th century AD (e.g., the Diamond Sutra, 868 AD)
    - Metal movable type was developed in Korea in the 13th century
    - Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century in Europe who developed a comprehensive system for printing with movable metal type that sparked a revolution
- Terminology from the Printing Press
    - Typeface: The design or style of a set of characters
    - Font: a font was a complete set of type of one size and style
    - Font Weight: Refers to the thickness of the strokes
    - Serif vs. Sans-serif: Serif fonts have small decorative strokes or "feet" at the ends of characters
    - Typesetting: The process of arranging type to prepare text for printing
    - Uppercase and Lowercase: These terms originated from how metal type was stored

## Week 2 Representing Text and Numbers in Computers

- Binary System
    - Bit: Short for binary didigt, represents one of two states ( 0 or 1 )
    - Byte: Group of 8 bits
    - Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2
- Computer Memory: Volatile vs. Non-Volatile
    - Volatile Memory (Short-Term): It is characterized by being very fast, allowing quick reading and writing of data. However, it is volatile, meaning its contents are lost entirely when the power is turned off
    - Non-Volatile Memory (Long-Term/Persistent Storage): This memory is used for storing data persistently, even when the power is off. It is optimized for capacity and cost-effectiveness rather than raw speed
- Units of Measurement
    - Kilobyte (KB): Roughly one thousand bytes
    - Megabyte (MB): Roughly one million bytes
    - Gigabyte (GB): Roughly one billion bytes
    - Terabyte (TB): Roughly one trillion bytes
- Number Representation
    - Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits
    - Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits
    - Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers
- Text Files vs. Binary Files
    - Text Files: These are files where the sequence of bytes is intended to represent human-readable text characters, typically encoded using a standard like ASCII
    - Binary Files: These are files where the sequence of bytes is not primarily intended to represent text characters
- Positional Number Systems and Bases
    - Decimal (Base 10): Uses 10 digits (0-9). Positions represent powers of 10
    - Binary (Base 2): Uses 2 digits (0, 1). Positions represent powers of 2
    - Octal (Base 8): Uses 8 digits (0-7). Positions represent powers of 8. Less common now, but used historically
    - Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses 16 digits. It uses 0-9, and then the letters A-F to represent the values 10 through 15

## Week 3 Structure of Text

- Historical Perspectives on Text Structure
    - Ancient Manuscripts and Early Printing: Consider a page printed around 500 years ago in Venice, a major center for early printing
    - Ledgers and Tables: It's structured like a table, with clear rows and columns. Each column is dedicated to a specific type of information (e.g., quantity, price, item description)
    - Newspapers: It features huge titles (headlines), columns of text, and often images. The structure prioritizes grabbing attention and organizing diverse information into easily digestible sections.
- Markup Languages
    - Markdown: a very popular, simple markup language. It's designed to be easy to read and write in its raw text form, while still being easily convertible (rendered) into formatted documents (like HTML).
    - HTML: more verbose than Markdown but offers much greater flexibility and control over presentation and structure.
- Special Characters and Escaping
    - Special Characters: 
        - Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *
        - Escape sequences prevent special interpretation
        - Example: \# to display # in Markdown
    - HTML Escaping:
        - Use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &amp; for &.
- Structured Data
    - JSON (Javascript Object Notation) a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate
        - Objects: Key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys are strings, values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other objects
        - Arrays: Ordered lists of values, enclosed in square brackets []
    - XML (Extensible Markup Language) more verbose than JSON but also more flexible in defining complex document structures. It uses tags similar to HTML but allows defining custom tag names
        - Tags: <tag>value</tag>

## Week 4 Manipulating Text & Text Editors

- Keyboards
    - Importance: Keyboards and mice are our primary interface to convey thoughts/intentions to the computer. Mastering the keyboard is key
    - History: Word comes from musical instruments. Early typing keyboards looked like piano keys but quickly evolved to the modern layout for mechanical/convenience reasons
    - Types:
          - Standard 104-key layout
          - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards
    - Layouts:
          - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak
- Modifier Keys and Shortcuts
    - Keys like Control, Shift, and Alt
    - Ctrl + C (copy)
    - Ctrl + V (paste)
    - Ctrl + Z (undo)
    - Ctrl + F for finding text
- Text Editors
    - Distinction:
          - Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word): Convenient for documents intended for human reading/printing. Very inconvenient for writing code (auto-correct, hidden formatting)
          - Text Editors (e.g., Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, Vim): Provide precise control over the raw text file. Essential for writing code
          - Unicode optionally, mention how in UTF-8 some characters are represented using multiple bytes
    - IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
          - Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm
          - Combine a text editor with many other tools for software development (compilers, debuggers, build tools, version control integration, etc.)
          - Historically distinct, now blurring the line with advanced text editors
    - History:
          - Vi (later Vim) and Emacs: Released around the same time (1976). Famous for sparking "religious wars" among developers
          - Still widely used today. Vim is often pre-installed on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), making it a common default terminal editor
          - Mention Vim's modal nature (insert mode for typing, command mode for actions)
          - Show how to exit Vim: Esc, then :q!, then Enter
    - VS Code (Visual Studio Code):
          - Developed by Microsoft, but is open source and free (distinct from the commercial Visual Studio IDE)
          - Pros: Very popular (useful for collaboration, internships), feature-rich, large extension ecosystem
          - Cons: Can become resource-heavy especially if many extensions are installed
          - A solid choice for beginners and experienced developers alike, offering a good balance of features, performance, and ease of use
## Week 5 Command Line Interfaces
- What is the Command Line?
    - Command Line Interfaces (CLI) are a way of interacting with a computer by typing text commands. While they might seem intimidating or archaic, they remain a powerful and essential tool for software developers
- History and Evolution:
    - CLI was the only way to interact with computers
    - Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens
    - Commands are often short due to historical reasons
- Anatomy of a Modern CLI
    - Prompt: The text before where you type the command (e.g., user@hostname:~/current/directory$). A ~ symbol is a common shorthand for the user's home directory
    - Command: The instruction you want the computer to perform (e.g., command)
    - Argument: Additional information the command needs to operate on (e.g., argument, often a file or directory name)
    - Option/Flag: Modifiers that change the command's behavior (e.g., -option, --long-option). Short options use a single dash (-) followed by a letter; long options use a double dash (--) followed by a word
    - Cursor: A blinking indicator showing where your typed text will appear
    - Response/Output: The text the computer prints after executing the command
- Why Use the CLI? (Advantages)
    - Access to Functionality: Some tools and functionalities are only available via the command line. Building GUIs is complex and expensive, so developers often create command-line tools first (or exclusively)
    - Speed: For specific tasks, especially repetitive ones or manipulating many files, the command line can be significantly faster than using a GUI
    - Precise Control: CLIs often offer granular control over operations through various options and arguments, allowing you to specify exactly what you want the computer to do
    - Automation (Scripting): Since commands are just lines of text, you can easily write sequences of commands in a file (called a script). Running the script executes all commands automatically, ideal for repetitive tasks
    - Remote Work & Low Bandwidth: CLIs require very little data to communicate (sending text commands, receiving text output). This makes them highly efficient for working on remote computers over slow or unstable network connections
    - Low Resource Usage: CLIs don't require graphical rendering, making them suitable for running on less powerful or specialized computers (like servers or embedded devices) that may not have a GUI
- Remote Access with SSH
    - The primary tool for this is SSH (Secure Shell)
    - SSH provides an encrypted connection between your computer and a remote server, ensuring privacy for your communication
    - Basic usage: ssh username@server_address
    - Shell: Refers to the command-line environment you get on the remote machine
    - You will then be prompted for the password for that username on the remote server. Once connected, you see a command prompt for that remote server and can execute commands there as if you were sitting in front of it (but limited to text-based interaction)
- Starting the Terminal on Your Computer
    - Mac OS:
          - Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space) -> Type "Terminal" -> Enter
          - Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal
    - Windows:
          - Start Menu -> Search bar -> Type "Terminal", "Cmd" or "Powershell"
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): For Windows users who want a more Linux-like command-line environment, WSL allows you to run a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu) within Windows. You can install it from the Microsoft Store. This is particularly useful for certain types of software development (like web development with Node.js) where tools often work better on Linux or macOS
- Basic CLI Commands
    - ls: List files in a directory
    - cd: Change directory
    - pwd: Print working directory
    - cat: Display file contents
    - less: View file contents interactively
    - cp: Copy files
    - mv: Move files
    - mkdir: Create a directory
    - ping: Test network connectivity
    - grep: Search text using patterns
    - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands
    - General format: command [subcommand] [options/flags] [arguments]
    - Command: The main program name (e.g., ls, cat, cd)
    - cp source destination: Copy files or directories
    - mv source destination: Move (rename) files or directories
    - mkdir directory_name: Make (create) a new directory
    - ping hostname_or_ip: Send network packets to a host to test connectivity and measure latency
        - Use Ctrl+C to stop ping
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    - Run Linux within Windows for development
    - Use Linux tools and commands alongside Windows applications
    - Often preferred for certain types of development (e.g., web development with Node.js, Ruby, Python) where tools are primarily optimized for Linux/Mac OS
    - Can integrate with tools like VS Code (VS Code runs on Windows, but can operate on files and run commands within the WSL environment)
- Other Network/CLI Tools
    - scp (Secure Copy): Copy files over an SSH connection
          - scp local_file user@server:remote_path
    - ftp / sftp (File Transfer Protocol / Secure FTP): Protocols for transferring files. Sftp is the secure, encrypted version
          - Often used with GUI clients like Filezilla - a GUI application for file transfer between local and remote servers
- Text-Based User Interfaces (TUI)
    - htop: A TUI application for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, processes) in real-time. It provides a visual layout within the terminal window and updates dynamically. You typically press q to exit.
    - tmux: Terminal Multiplexer. A powerful tool for managing multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It allows you to split panes, create windows, and, crucially, keep sessions running on a remote server even if your connection disconnects. You can later reconnect and resume your tmux session exactly as you left it
